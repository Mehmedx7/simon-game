## Section A: Simon Game

The **Simon Game** is a memory-based game that challenges users to repeat an increasing sequence of colored buttons. The goal is to memorize the sequence and repeat it correctly.

### Features:
- **Memory Challenge:** Repeat the sequence of colors in the exact order.
- **Increasing Difficulty:** Each level adds one more color to the sequence.
- **Game Over:** When a user clicks an incorrect color, the game ends.
- **Responsive Design:** Works across both mobile and desktop screens.

## Section B: React JS - Folder Structure

This React app simulates a file/folder structure where each folder can be expanded or collapsed. It allows users to **create, edit, and delete files and folders** dynamically, and the tree structure is visually represented.

### Features:
- **Interactive Folders:** Click on folders to expand or collapse their contents.
- **Dynamic File System:** Users can create, edit, and delete files or folders.
- **Indentation:** Subfolders are properly indented to represent their depth in the hierarchy.
